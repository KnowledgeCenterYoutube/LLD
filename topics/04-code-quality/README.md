## Best Practices

### 1. Writing Clean Code
- Use meaningful names
- Write small, focused functions
- Document code effectively
- Handle errors properly
- Organize code logically

### 2. Refactoring
- Identify code smells
- Make small, incremental changes
- Maintain test coverage
- Document decisions
- Review regularly

### 3. Testing
- Write clear, focused tests
- Follow testing patterns
- Maintain test independence
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Regular maintenance

### 4. Code Reviews
- Follow review process
- Focus on key areas
- Provide constructive feedback
- Address issues promptly
- Maintain documentation

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Clean Code
- Unclear naming
- Long functions
- Poor documentation
- Inadequate error handling
- Poor organization

### 2. Refactoring
- Over-refactoring
- Breaking functionality
- Incomplete refactoring
- No test coverage
- No documentation

### 3. Testing
- Brittle tests
- Testing implementation
- Incomplete coverage
- Dependent tests
- Poor organization

### 4. Code Reviews
- Incomplete reviews
- Overlooking edge cases
- Ignoring performance
- Poor feedback
- No follow-up

## Tools and Resources
