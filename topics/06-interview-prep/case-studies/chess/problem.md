# Chess Game - Problem Statement

## Overview
Design a chess game system that can handle the game rules, piece movements, and game state. The system should support a complete chess game with all standard rules and piece movements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. The system should support all chess pieces:
   - Pawn
   - Rook
   - Knight
   - Bishop
   - Queen
   - King
2. Each piece should have its specific movement rules
3. The system should:
   - Initialize a new game
   - Make moves
   - Validate moves
   - Check for check and checkmate
   - Track game state
   - Support castling
   - Support en passant
   - Support pawn promotion
   - Track captured pieces
   - Determine game end conditions

### Non-functional Requirements
1. The system should be thread-safe for potential multiplayer support
2. The system should be extensible for adding new features
3. The system should be maintainable and well-documented
4. The system should have proper error handling
5. The system should be efficient in terms of move validation

## Constraints
1. Standard 8x8 chess board
2. Standard chess rules apply
3. Each piece can only move according to its rules
4. A player cannot make a move that puts their king in check
5. A player must move out of check if their king is in check
6. The game ends when:
   - A player is checkmated
   - A player resigns
   - A draw is agreed upon
   - Stalemate occurs
   - Insufficient material
   - Threefold repetition
   - Fifty-move rule

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Create a new game
ChessGame game;

// Make a move
bool success = game.makeMove("e2", "e4");  // Move pawn from e2 to e4

// Check game state
GameState state = game.getGameState();
if (state == GameState::CHECK) {
    cout << "Check!" << endl;
}

// Get valid moves for a piece
vector<string> validMoves = game.getValidMoves("e4");

// Check if game is over
if (game.isGameOver()) {
    cout << "Game Over! " << game.getWinner() << " wins!" << endl;
}
```

## Design Considerations
1. How will you represent the chess board and pieces?
2. How will you implement piece movement rules?
3. How will you handle special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)?
4. How will you validate moves efficiently?
5. How will you detect check and checkmate?
6. How will you handle game state and history?
7. How will you implement the draw conditions?
8. How will you make the system extensible for future features?

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Object-oriented design
2. Code organization and readability
3. Move validation efficiency
4. Error handling
5. Extensibility
6. Test coverage
7. Documentation
8. Performance considerations
