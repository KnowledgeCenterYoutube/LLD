# Library Management System - Problem Statement

## Overview
Design a library management system that can handle book management, user management, and borrowing operations. The system should efficiently manage library resources and provide a seamless experience for both librarians and users.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Book Management:
   - Add new books to the library
   - Remove books from the library
   - Search books by title, author, ISBN
   - Track book availability
   - Manage book categories/genres
   - Handle multiple copies of the same book

2. User Management:
   - Register new users
   - Update user information
   - Track user borrowing history
   - Manage user accounts
   - Handle different user types (student, faculty, staff)

3. Borrowing Operations:
   - Borrow books
   - Return books
   - Renew books
   - Track due dates
   - Handle late returns
   - Manage reservations

4. Fine Management:
   - Calculate fines for late returns
   - Track fine payments
   - Handle fine waivers
   - Generate fine reports

5. Reporting:
   - Generate book availability reports
   - Track popular books
   - Monitor user borrowing patterns
   - Generate fine collection reports

### Non-functional Requirements
1. The system should be thread-safe for concurrent operations
2. The system should be scalable to handle large libraries
3. The system should be maintainable and well-documented
4. The system should have proper error handling
5. The system should be efficient in terms of search operations

## Constraints
1. A user can borrow up to 5 books at a time
2. Books can be borrowed for 14 days
3. Books can be renewed up to 2 times
4. Fine rate is $1 per day for late returns
5. Users with outstanding fines cannot borrow new books
6. Maximum fine limit is $50 per user

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Create library system
LibrarySystem library;

// Add a book
Book book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "978-0743273565");
library.addBook(book);

// Register a user
User user("John Doe", "john@example.com", UserType::STUDENT);
library.registerUser(user);

// Borrow a book
library.borrowBook(user.getId(), book.getIsbn());

// Return a book
library.returnBook(user.getId(), book.getIsbn());

// Search books
vector<Book> results = library.searchBooks("Gatsby");

// Generate report
Report report = library.generateBorrowingReport();
```

## Design Considerations
1. How will you represent books and users?
2. How will you handle concurrent borrowing operations?
3. How will you implement the search functionality?
4. How will you track book availability?
5. How will you manage the fine system?
6. How will you handle book reservations?
7. How will you implement the reporting system?
8. How will you make the system extensible for future features?

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Object-oriented design
2. Code organization and readability
3. Search efficiency
4. Error handling
5. Extensibility
6. Test coverage
7. Documentation
8. Performance considerations
