# Restaurant Ordering System - Problem Statement

## Overview
Design a restaurant ordering system that can handle menu management, order processing, and payment operations. The system should efficiently manage restaurant operations and provide a seamless experience for both staff and customers.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Menu Management:
   - Add/remove menu items
   - Update item prices
   - Manage item categories
   - Track item availability
   - Handle special offers/discounts
   - Support multiple languages

2. Order Management:
   - Create new orders
   - Add/remove items from orders
   - Modify order quantities
   - Track order status
   - Handle order cancellations
   - Support order splitting
   - Manage table reservations

3. Payment Processing:
   - Process different payment methods
   - Handle split payments
   - Apply discounts
   - Generate receipts
   - Track payment status
   - Support refunds

4. Kitchen Management:
   - Receive order notifications
   - Update order preparation status
   - Handle special cooking instructions
   - Manage preparation time
   - Track order priority

5. Reporting:
   - Generate sales reports
   - Track popular items
   - Monitor order patterns
   - Analyze payment methods
   - Generate inventory reports

### Non-functional Requirements
1. The system should be thread-safe for concurrent operations
2. The system should be scalable to handle multiple restaurants
3. The system should be maintainable and well-documented
4. The system should have proper error handling
5. The system should be efficient in terms of order processing

## Constraints
1. Maximum order size: 20 items
2. Maximum preparation time: 45 minutes
3. Maximum table reservation time: 2 hours
4. Maximum discount: 30%
5. Minimum order amount: $5
6. Maximum split payment ways: 4

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Create restaurant system
RestaurantSystem restaurant;

// Add menu items
MenuItem item1("Margherita Pizza", 12.99, "Pizza", true);
restaurant.addMenuItem(item1);

// Create order
Order order(1); // Table 1
order.addItem(item1, 2); // 2 pizzas

// Process payment
Payment payment(order.getTotal());
payment.addPaymentMethod(PaymentMethod::CREDIT_CARD, 25.98);

// Update order status
restaurant.updateOrderStatus(order.getId(), OrderStatus::PREPARING);
```

## Design Considerations
1. How will you represent menu items and categories?
2. How will you handle concurrent order processing?
3. How will you implement the payment system?
4. How will you track order status?
5. How will you manage table reservations?
6. How will you handle special requests?
7. How will you implement the reporting system?
8. How will you make the system extensible for future features?

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Object-oriented design
2. Code organization and readability
3. Order processing efficiency
4. Error handling
5. Extensibility
6. Test coverage
7. Documentation
8. Performance considerations
