# Design Patterns Summary

## Overview
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. They provide a shared vocabulary and best practices for creating maintainable, flexible, and reusable code. This summary covers all three categories of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in how objects are created, composed, and represented.

1. **Abstract Factory**
   - Creates families of related objects
   - Hides implementation details
   - Ensures compatibility between objects

2. **Builder**
   - Constructs complex objects step by step
   - Separates construction from representation
   - Supports different object representations

3. **Factory Method**
   - Creates objects without specifying exact class
   - Defers instantiation to subclasses
   - Provides flexibility in object creation

4. **Prototype**
   - Creates new objects by cloning existing ones
   - Reduces subclassing
   - Hides complexity of object creation

5. **Singleton**
   - Ensures a class has only one instance
   - Provides global access point
   - Controls object creation

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

1. **Adapter**
   - Makes incompatible interfaces work together
   - Wraps existing interface
   - Enables collaboration between classes

2. **Bridge**
   - Separates abstraction from implementation
   - Allows independent variation
   - Reduces inheritance hierarchy

3. **Composite**
   - Composes objects into tree structures
   - Treats individual and composite objects uniformly
   - Simplifies client code

4. **Decorator**
   - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
   - Provides flexible alternative to subclassing
   - Maintains single responsibility principle

5. **Facade**
   - Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
   - Reduces coupling between subsystems
   - Promotes subsystem independence

6. **Flyweight**
   - Shares objects to reduce memory usage
   - Manages large numbers of similar objects
   - Optimizes memory consumption

7. **Proxy**
   - Controls access to another object
   - Provides placeholder for another object
   - Adds level of indirection

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. **Chain of Responsibility**
   - Passes requests along a chain of handlers
   - Decouples sender from receiver
   - Allows multiple objects to handle request

2. **Command**
   - Encapsulates a request as an object
   - Parameterizes clients with different requests
   - Supports undoable operations

3. **Interpreter**
   - Implements a specialized language
   - Defines grammatical representation
   - Provides interpreter for language

4. **Iterator**
   - Accesses elements of a collection sequentially
   - Hides collection implementation
   - Supports multiple traversal methods

5. **Mediator**
   - Defines simplified communication between classes
   - Centralizes complex communications
   - Reduces coupling between components

6. **Memento**
   - Captures and restores object state
   - Maintains encapsulation
   - Supports undo/redo functionality

7. **Observer**
   - Defines one-to-many dependency between objects
   - Maintains consistency between objects
   - Supports broadcast communication

8. **State**
   - Allows object to alter behavior when state changes
   - Encapsulates state-specific behavior
   - Simplifies state transitions

9. **Strategy**
   - Defines a family of algorithms
   - Makes algorithms interchangeable
   - Encapsulates algorithm implementation

10. **Template Method**
    - Defines skeleton of algorithm
    - Lets subclasses override specific steps
    - Controls algorithm flow

11. **Visitor**
    - Separates algorithm from object structure
    - Adds new operations without changing classes
    - Groups related operations

## Pattern Relationships

### Cross-Category Relationships
1. **Abstract Factory and Factory Method**
   - Abstract Factory uses Factory Methods
   - Both deal with object creation
   - Different levels of abstraction

2. **Composite and Iterator**
   - Composite structures need iteration
   - Iterator traverses composite structures
   - Common in tree-like structures

3. **Command and Memento**
   - Command for action encapsulation
   - Memento for state restoration
   - Together enable undo/redo

4. **Observer and Mediator**
   - Observer for loose coupling
   - Mediator for centralized communication
   - Both manage object interactions

### Common Combinations
1. **Builder and Factory Method**
   - Builder creates complex objects
   - Factory Method creates parts
   - Together handle complex creation

2. **Decorator and Composite**
   - Both use recursive composition
   - Decorator adds responsibilities
   - Composite builds tree structures

3. **State and Strategy**
   - State changes behavior
   - Strategy selects behavior
   - Both involve behavior variation

## Best Practices

### Pattern Selection
1. Understand the problem first
2. Consider pattern relationships
3. Evaluate trade-offs
4. Keep implementations simple
5. Document pattern usage

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow pattern structure
2. Maintain pattern intent
3. Consider maintenance
4. Test pattern usage
5. Review pattern effectiveness

## Real-World Applications
