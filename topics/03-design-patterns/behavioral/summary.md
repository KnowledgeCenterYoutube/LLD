# Behavioral Design Patterns Summary

## Overview
Behavioral patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time.

## Relationships Between Patterns

### Complementary Patterns
1. **Command and Memento**
   - Command for action encapsulation
   - Memento for state restoration
   - Together they enable undo/redo functionality

2. **Observer and Mediator**
   - Observer for loose coupling
   - Mediator for centralized communication
   - Together they manage complex interactions

3. **State and Strategy**
   - State for behavior changes
   - Strategy for algorithm selection
   - Both involve behavior variation

4. **Template Method and Strategy**
   - Template Method for algorithm structure
   - Strategy for algorithm variation
   - Different approaches to algorithm customization

### Pattern Combinations
1. **Chain of Responsibility + Command**
   - Command objects passed through chain
   - Enables complex request processing

2. **Observer + Mediator**
   - Mediator as subject
   - Components as observers
   - Manages complex component interactions

3. **State + Strategy**
   - State determines strategy
   - Strategy implements state behavior
   - Flexible behavior management

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Pattern
1. **Chain of Responsibility**
   - Multiple objects can handle a request
   - Handler is not known a priori
   - Request should be processed by multiple objects

2. **Command**
   - Need to parameterize objects with operations
   - Need to queue operations
   - Need to support undo/redo

3. **Interpreter**
   - Need to interpret a language
   - Grammar is simple
   - Performance is not critical

4. **Iterator**
   - Need to access collection elements
   - Want to hide collection implementation
   - Need multiple traversal methods

5. **Mediator**
   - Objects communicate in complex ways
   - Need to reduce coupling
   - Need centralized communication

6. **Memento**
   - Need to save object state
   - Direct state access is not desirable
   - Need to support undo/redo

7. **Observer**
   - Need to maintain consistency
   - Change in one object affects others
   - Need loose coupling

8. **State**
   - Object behavior depends on state
   - States are well-defined
   - State transitions are clear

9. **Strategy**
   - Need to define a family of algorithms
   - Algorithms are interchangeable
   - Need to hide algorithm implementation

10. **Template Method**
    - Have an algorithm with invariant steps
    - Want to let subclasses customize steps
    - Need to control algorithm flow

11. **Visitor**
    - Need to perform operations across objects
    - Want to add new operations
    - Operations are related

### Implementation Tips
1. Keep patterns focused and simple
